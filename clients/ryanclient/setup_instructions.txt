using some instructions from around slide 142 of https://github.com/DynamoRIO/dynamorio/releases/download/release_7_0_0_rc1/DynamoRIO-tutorial-feb2017.pdf

0. open up the dynamorio folder. i'll call this DRROOT
1. in dynamorio folder (DRROOT), mkdir build && cd build
2. inside build, cmake .. && make -j (need to make to generate certain autogenerated header files)
3. go back to dynamorio root (DRROOT) then in the clients folder, make a folder for your new client (e.g. ryanclient)
4. in that new client folder (e.g. ryanclient), make a .c file for your client.
5. include these headers "dr_api.h" and "drmgr.h"
6. in VSCode, open your client file and then go to your C/C++ Configurations and set up include path to:
${workspaceFolder}/**
and add these defines (assuming you're developing on x64 Linux):
LINUX
X86_64
7. make a CMakeLists.txt in your client folder and add the following:
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.7)

project(ryanclient)
add_library(ryanclient SHARED ryanclient.c)
find_package(DynamoRIO)
if (NOT DynamoRIO_FOUND)
    message(FATAL_ERROR "DynamoRIO package required to build")
endif(NOT DynamoRIO_FOUND)
configure_DynamoRIO_client(ryanclient)
use_DynamoRIO_extension(ryanclient drmgr)
8. when you go back to the build folder and do cmake .. then make -j, it should just link your client now!

9. im not yet sure how to actually RUN dynamorio with the client we made... tba!
